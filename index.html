            <p>My interest in software development spawns from my creative nature. The Arts are my life-long passion and I dabble in many mediums with my favorites being painting, ink, poetry, and theatre.</p>
            <p>I did not enjoy the stress of surviving on my artistic talents and changed my focus to business administration. From there I discovered the creativity in computers! Software development compliments my creative personality and problem solving skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of my educational goals my free time is spent swimming, running, painting, and writing. When I need a break from studying, I like to play my favorite guitar. I'm also an appreciator of good jokes and my least favorite writing topic is ME!</p>
            <p>The handsome gentleman in the image is Reishi. We rescued him three years ago and he's made a great recovery. We can't imagine life without him! His hobbies include walks, cuddles, and playing with Mini-Bear, his favorite toy.</p>
