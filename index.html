    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/Angela2.jpg" alt="Angela" title="Angela Ivey 2019" />
   
    <p>My interest in software development spawns from my creative nature. The Arts are my life-long passion and I dabble in many mediums with my favorites being painting, ink, poetry, and theatre.</p>
    <p>I did not enjoy the stress of surviving on my artistic talents and changed my focus to business administration. From there I discovered the creativity in computers! Software development compliments my creative personality and problem solving skills.</p>
    <p>Outside of my educational goals my free time is spent swimming, running, painting, and writing. When I need a break from studying, I like to play my favorite guitar.</p>
    <p>I'm also an appreciator of good jokes and my least favorite writing topic is ME!</p>
